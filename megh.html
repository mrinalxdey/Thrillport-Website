        <h1>ABOUT</h1>
        <p>&emsp;Meghalaya is a state in northeast India. Meghalaya was formed on 21 January 1972 by carving out two districts from the state of Assam: the United Khasi Hills and Jaintia Hills and the Garo Hills.<br>
        &emsp;The state is bound to the south by the Bangladeshi divisions of Mymensingh and Sylhet, to the west by the Bangladeshi division of Rangpur, and to the north and east by India's State of Assam. The capital of Meghalaya is Shillong. During the British rule of India, the British imperial authorities nicknamed it the "Scotland of the East". English is the official language of Meghalaya.

        <h1>BEST TIME TO VISIT</h1>
        <p>&emsp;Often called the abode of clouds, the best time to visit Meghalaya is between <strong>October and June</strong>. Most tourist destinations in the state receive temperatures that rarely go beyond 30Â°C, making it a perfect escape between March and June which is the summer season in the country. It is also a favourite during <strong>autumn and winters</strong>, i.e. from October to November and December to February amongst tourists who come from high or moderate temperature zones. Not recommended to tourists during peak monsoons.</p>
