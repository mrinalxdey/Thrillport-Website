        <h1>ABOUT</h1>
        <p>&emsp;Sikkim is a state in northeastern India. It borders the Tibet Autonomous Region of China in the north and northeast, Bhutan in the east, Koshi Province of Nepal in the west, and West Bengal in the south.
        <br>
        &emsp;Sikkim is the least populous and second smallest among the Indian states. Situated in the Eastern Himalaya, Sikkim is notable for its biodiversity, including alpine and subtropical climates, as well as being a host to Kangchenjunga, the highest peak in India and third highest on Earth.

        <h1>BEST TIME TO VISIT</h1>
        <p>&emsp;The best time to visit Sikkim is from <strong>March to June and from September to December</strong> when the weather is favourable. In the months of January and February, Sikkim receives snowfall and in the monsoon months (July to August) it is better to avoid visiting since there is a risk of landslides.  The weather remains balmy in summers. Snowfall is observed in the winter month (Late December to February).</p>
